# How to run the feedfeeder application.

Double click on the index.html file, to be deliver with great feed content

# Etras:

## additional tests for the current functionality:
Checks if the options in the menu are the same number as the urls defined in the app.js


## test driven development
(I find this concept increadibly exciting)
I decided I'd want a link that would fetch more articles.
The *Get More Articles* test suite, checks if there are more articles after the link has been clicked.



# questions
Will the click trigger in the *Get More Articles*, once the get more articles link works,  actually get more articles upon load, and how can I prevent it from doing so?
